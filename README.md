GITHUB PROFILE REPLICA
===================

The task of this project was to create a functioning replica of my github profile.
By the end of this project I was able to breakdown a complex sequence into a series of steps, using jQuery AJAX, handling callbacks and asynchronous code, and writing to the DOM with JS.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Requirements

 **All functions and code should work according to the following:**
 
 - A github profile app that prints out some info from the Github API and your repos. For the design, you should recreate the Github Repos Tab to the best of your ability.
 - The information from the Github API displayed includes information from your github user account and repositories from: 

> 	https://api.github.com/users/<username>
> 	https://api.github.com/users/<username>/repos

 - After loading data from the Github API,  the following information were written to the DOM:

		

> name 		
> bio 		
> email 		
>html_url 		
>all repositories
